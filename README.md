# Robotic Toolbox
RTB Robotics Toolbox created by Peter Corke uses existing robotics models to find the inverse kinematics solutions. 
You can import the widely used robot models and calculate the inverse kinematics solutions for them.

## Description

In these codes, the inverse kinematics of Franka Emika Panda robot has been programmed. Franka Emika Panda is 7 DoF Robotic Arm. In the code, URDF of the Panda robot is imported and serial linkage has been defined. Forward Kinematics and Inverse Kinematics both calculations are shown in the notebook. Python code can be integrated with the ROS package to calculate the IK solution and send the joint values as ROS message.

### Dependencies

* Python 3.8 and above

### Executing program

* Run the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
* Run python code in any python IDE.
